# nip2-extras
[nip2](https://github.com/libvips/nip2) is a GUI for the [VIPS image processing library](https://libvips.github.io/libvips). This repository has been setup to share new functions and menu options for the nip2 software.

[nip2](https://github.com/libvips/nip2) is a very flexible piece of image processing software, all of its standard menu options from simple rotations to complex image based matrix manipulations are scripted as open and editable functions. These functions can be copied and edited or even linked together to created totally new options.

New [nip2](https://github.com/libvips/nip2) functions are created for lots of different individual reasons but can also often be useful for others so we will try to list them here.

# Documentation 
Please begin with the standard [nip2](https://github.com/libvips/nip2) [documentation](https://github.com/libvips/nip2#documentation) specific comments and documentation will be provided with each new function script.

# Dependencies
You will need [nip2](https://github.com/libvips/nip2) installed to make use of these scripts.
